## Project: HornedBeast

> I am building an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality, so you can read the below's description to get more information about this app. and you can contact me for more details.

> I am creating an application that displays images and information of horned animals. This application will allow the user to filter the images by number of horns and chose your favorite image.
> So I created a new React application using create-react-app and work on it now.
